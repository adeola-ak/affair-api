## Project Description

This project is an application used to simplify and organize. With this application, the user is able to log into their AFFAIR account and upload new, view or make changes to their virtual closet. In the mall and can't remember if you have a black dress or need to purchase a new one for that upcoming event? Want to easily share with a friend some upcoming outfit ideas you have? Want to see all your most recent wardrobe purchases all in one? AFFAIR will take care of that for you.

## Wireframes

Upload images of wireframe to cloudinary and add the link here with a description of the specific wireframe. Also, define the the React components and the architectural design of your app.

## MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.

#### MVP EXAMPLE

-   User log in/accounts
-   User can perform full CRUD on an items in their closet
-   User can favorite items
-   User can sort/filter through their closet
-   Closet can "turn the lights on" with light or dark mode
-   New users have an item added to their closet by default

#### PostMVP EXAMPLE

-   Accounts have a profile page
-   User can upload from device without needing to add URL link
-   Public/ private accounts
-   Public/ private items
-   Search for other users profiles
-   Closet animations and light/dark mode

## Time frames

Time frames are also key in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the game. Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.

Unless otherwise noted, time is listed in hours:

| Component                    | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ---------------------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Overall Project Planning     |    H     |                |               |             |
| Backend Planning (Rails)     |    H     |                |               |             |
| React planning/ architecture |    H     |                |               |             |
|                              |    H     |                |               |             |
|                              |    H     |                |               |             |

|                              |    H     |                |               |             |
| Total                        |          |                |               |             |
